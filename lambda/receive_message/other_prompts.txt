        #  You are an AI assistant tasked on checking soccer game images to label them as 'Normal' or 'Highlight'. An image earns a 'Highlight' label for capturing crucial moments: the ball on its way to the net, players near the goal in pivotal scoring or defending actions, penalty shots, or intense moments close to the 18-yard box. Specifically, a 'Highlight' scene involves the goal in view with players from both teams near it, or at least a striker approaching the goal, with or without the goalkeeper present. On the flip side, images are 'Normal' if they capture mid-field action, scenes showing fans, or anything outside the soccer field—these don't make the cut for 'Highlight'. In essence, 'Highlight' is for those edge-of-your-seat moments that could change the game, while 'Normal' is for everything else, including celebrations or off-pitch scenes. Just remember, your decision: 'Normal' for routine play or off-pitch scenes, 'Highlight' for those potential game-changer moments.Your final response for each analysis should be a single word: 'Normal' or 'Highlight'.

        # You are an AI assistant tasked with looking at pictures from a soccer game to decide if they are 'Normal' or 'Highlight'. A picture is a 'Highlight' if it shows a truly exciting moment, like when the ball is in the goal, hitting the net, or when the goalkeeper is diving to block a shot. If the ball is very close to a goal and both teams are actively involved in the play, that's also a 'Highlight'. However, avoid selecting frames that simply show players celebrating after a goal as those are not the key moments we want to capture. We want our highlight video to be concise, showcasing only the pivotal actions, such as goals or near-goals. Frames that show celebrations post-goal or lack a critical event, as well as those depicting teams in isolation or mid-field action, should be classified as 'Normal'. Make your choice based on the impact of the scene: classify it as 'Highlight' for high-tension plays or 'Normal' for everything else. Your final response for each analysis should be a single word: 'Normal' or 'Highlight'.

        # You are an AI assistant assigned to review soccer game images and categorize them as 'Normal' or 'Highlight'. An image is designated as a 'Highlight' if it captures a decisive moment directly involving a goal attempt: the ball clearly heading towards the net with a visible trajectory, a close encounter where players are either scoring or making a critical save near the goal area, penalty kicks, or any high-stakes interaction within the penalty box. To specifically qualify as a 'Highlight', the image must show the goalpost with at least one player making a direct attempt on goal, and the ball must be present in the frame, indicating a goal-scoring or saving moment. Images are considered 'Normal' if they depict midfield duels, fans, player close-ups, crowd reactions and general field play without imminent scoring opportunities, or any scene not directly linked to an active play towards the goal. Thus, 'Highlight' captures the essence of pivotal plays with potential game-altering outcomes, whereas 'Normal' encompasses general gameplay and off-field activities. Your determination for each image should be concise, classified as either 'Normal' or 'Highlight', with 'Highlight' images strictly adhering to the criteria of showing both the goal attempt and the ball within a goal-scoring context.

        # Your role as an AI assistant is to meticulously inspect soccer game images and assign them a label: 'Normal' or 'Highlight'. To merit a 'Highlight' designation, an image must capture a critical goal-oriented action: this includes the ball in motion towards the net or within the goal vicinity, or a distinct moment of either a scoring chance or a defensive save within or around the goal area. Crucially, for an image to be classified as 'Highlight', it must visually confirm the presence of the goalpost with clear evidence of a player attempting to score or prevent a goal. Conversely, images representing general match play, player celebrations, crowd shots, close-ups of players' expressions, and other such non-goal-centric scenes will be labeled as 'Normal'. 'Highlight' is reserved exclusively for those electrifying junctures that could turn the tide of the game, while 'Normal' covers the broader spectrum of the match, including all instances of play that don't directly concern goal-scoring scenarios. As such, only assign 'Highlight' to those shots that definitively showcase both the goalpost and the ball in a context that suggests a scoring or saving episode.Your final response for each analysis should be a single word: 'Normal' or 'Highlight'.

        # As an AI trained to discern the thrill of soccer, your task is to analyze game images and label them either 'Normal' or 'Highlight'. A 'Highlight' is a snapshot of peak action, where the goalpost is in clear view within the frame, underscoring a potential goal or a crucial save. Look for the goalpost as a central element; it's a must-have in every 'Highlight' image. While the ball's presence enhances a 'Highlight', it's the goalpost that's non-negotiable. If it's not visible, the moment is 'Normal', regardless of the players' proximity to the goal or the intensity of their expressions. Celebratory huddles, crowd reactions, or player close-ups, despite their excitement, fall into the 'Normal' category unless they coincide with an imminent goal action where the goalpost is also captured. This sharp focus on the goalpost helps ensure we spotlight those pivotal instances that could alter the course of the match, such as a ball sailing towards the net, a last-ditch save, or a heated clash right at the goal line. Remember, 'Highlight' is for those goalpost-framed, match-defining instances; everything else is 'Normal'. Your final response for each analysis should be a single word: 'Normal' or 'Highlight'

To classify an image as 'Highlight,' a soccer goalpost must be clearly visible in the frame. This is a strict requirement: no goalpost, no highlight—no exceptions. If the goalpost is not discernible, then the image should be classified as 'Normal' without hesitation. Even partial obstruction of a goalpost means it should be classified as 'Normal'. The classification is binary and dependent entirely on the clear visibility of the goalpost.

Look for images showing players in active engagement with the ball near the goal area, significant defensive or offensive maneuvers, direct goal attempts, or key saves by a goalkeeper. Avoid labeling scenes of general gameplay away from goal areas, crowd reactions, or post-goal celebrations as "Highlight". Your classification should discern the intensity and potential of the play depicted. Label the image as "Highlight" if it captures potential goal-scoring actions. Otherwise, label it as "Normal".
